# Screenmancy: A lightweight UI library for Dual Universe screens

This library is meant to help you creating interactive interfaces in-game without needing to spend time messing with math, specially to find screen positions, etc.

To use it, you might need the [DU-LuaC compiler](https://github.com/wolfe-labs/DU-LuaC) utility.

## Features

- Syntax similar to OOP platforms such as WinForms
- Event handling built-in, thanks to [the Core library](https://github.com/wolfe-labs/DU-Core)
